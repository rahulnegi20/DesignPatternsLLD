The Adapter Pattern is a structural design pattern used to allow two incompatible interfaces to work together. The adapter acts as a bridge between two interfaces, converting the interface of a class into another interface that a client expects. This pattern is especially useful when integrating third-party libraries, legacy code, or different systems.
Real-Life Example: Power Socket Adapter

Imagine you’re traveling with a laptop that has a Type-A plug, but the power sockets in the country you’re visiting use a Type-C socket. You can use a power adapter to allow your laptop’s plug to fit into the Type-C socket, allowing your laptop to charge without any modifications to its original design.

In software, the Adapter Pattern can similarly be used to bridge the gap between an expected interface and an incompatible service.
Example Scenario in Code: Payment System Integration

Suppose you have an e-commerce platform that has a standardized PaymentProcessor interface. You want to integrate a new third-party payment gateway, but it doesn’t conform to the PaymentProcessor interface. We can use the Adapter Pattern to make it compatible.







Explanation

    Target Interface (PaymentProcessor): Defines the standard method process_payment, which all payment processors in our system should have.
    Incompatible Interface (StripePayment): A new payment gateway with a different method make_payment.
    Adapter (StripeAdapter): Wraps the StripePayment class, adapting it to the PaymentProcessor interface by implementing process_payment and calling make_payment inside it.

Real-World Use Cases for the Adapter Pattern

    Third-Party Library Integration: Adapting third-party libraries or services with different APIs to work within your system.
    Legacy Code: Wrapping legacy code with a new interface to make it compatible with modern systems.
    Data Format Conversion: Adapting data between different formats or protocols, such as XML to JSON conversions.
