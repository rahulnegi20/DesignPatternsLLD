The Template Method Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class and allows subclasses to override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure. This pattern promotes code reuse and keeps the core logic in one place while letting subclasses define the finer details.
Real-Life Example: Online Order Processing

Consider an online order processing system where different types of orders need to be processed (e.g., in-store pickup, home delivery, and international delivery). Each type of order follows a similar general process but has some unique steps. With the Template Method pattern, we define the common steps in a base class and let subclasses handle the unique details.
Implementation of the Template Method Pattern

    We define a base class with a process_order template method containing the core steps.
    Some of these steps are implemented in the base class, while others are abstract and meant to be overridden by subclasses.

Explanation

    Template Method (process_order): Defined in the OrderProcessor base class, it outlines the steps in the order processing pipeline.
    Abstract Methods (payment and delivery): These methods are defined in the base class but implemented differently in each subclass.
    Concrete Methods (select_item and send_confirmation): These steps are shared by all subclasses and are implemented in the base class.

Real-World Use Cases for the Template Method Pattern

    Document Processing: In an application generating different types of documents (e.g., PDF, HTML, Word), shared steps (like loading data) can be in a template method, while formatting can vary by subclass.
    Data Import: Importing data from different sources (CSV, JSON, XML) may follow a common process where only the data parsing step varies by file type.
    Games: In a game engine, a generic game loop can be defined in the base class, while subclasses define specific behavior, like rendering or updating different types of objects.
    UI Components: If creating similar UI components with different stylings or behaviors, the common setup could be in a base class, and specific implementations could be in subclasses.

The Template Method pattern is ideal for situations where the overall process is the same, but specific details can vary across subclasses. It helps avoid code duplication, keeps the process consistent, and provides flexibility for extending functionality through inheritance.
