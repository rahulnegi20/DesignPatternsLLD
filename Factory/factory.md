Let’s look at a real-world use case for the Factory Pattern in a notification system. Imagine we’re building an application that can send notifications via multiple channels, such as Email, SMS, and Push Notifications. The type of notification sent might depend on user preferences or certain conditions.

Using the Factory Pattern here helps us:

    Keep the notification sending logic organized.
    Easily add new notification types without modifying existing code.
    Decouple the client from concrete notification classes.

Implementation Steps

    Define a Notification Interface: Create a common interface for all types of notifications.
    Concrete Notification Classes: Implement the interface in specific classes like EmailNotification, SMSNotification, and PushNotification.
    Notification Factory: Implement a factory class that creates the appropriate notification type based on input.
