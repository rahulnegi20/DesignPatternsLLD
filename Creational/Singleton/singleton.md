The Singleton Pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across a system, such as in managing configurations, logging, or database connections.
Key Concepts of the Singleton Pattern

    Single Instance: Only one instance of the class is created.
    Global Access Point: The single instance is accessible globally across the application.
    Lazy Initialization (Optional): The instance is created only when itâ€™s first needed.

Real-World Example: Database Connection

In many applications, we need a single database connection pool. Creating multiple connections can consume too many resources and may lead to inconsistencies. Using the Singleton Pattern, we ensure only one database connection object exists.
