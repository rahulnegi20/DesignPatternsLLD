The Prototype Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows you to create new objects by copying or "cloning" an existing object (the "prototype") instead of instantiating a new one from scratch. This pattern is particularly useful when object creation is costly or complex, and you want to reuse existing objects with some modifications.
Key Concepts of the Prototype Pattern

    Prototype: The base interface or abstract class that declares the clone method, allowing objects to make copies of themselves.
    Concrete Prototype: Implements the clone method and is the class of the object to be copied.
    Client: Uses the prototype to create new objects by copying existing ones.
