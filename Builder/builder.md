The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides a way to construct complex objects step-by-step. It allows you to create different representations of the same type of object by assembling the necessary parts in a specific order. The Builder Pattern is particularly useful when an object has a large number of optional properties, or when the construction process is complex and requires multiple steps.
Key Concepts of the Builder Pattern

    Builder: This interface defines all possible steps that can be taken to construct an object.
    Concrete Builder: Implements the Builder interface and provides specific parts of the product.
    Product: The final object that is being built, which will consist of all the parts added during the construction process.
    Director (Optional): The Director is an optional class that defines the order of construction steps and guides the building process.

The Builder Pattern is commonly used in cases where:

    The object requires many attributes to be initialized.
    The construction of the object is complex and requires multiple steps.
    The objectâ€™s attributes are optional and need flexibility in building.

Real-World Example: Building a Customizable Vacation Package

Imagine a vacation package builder where users can customize various options like destination, accommodation, transport, activities, and meals. Users may not need to fill out all fields, and each field has specific details. The Builder Pattern allows the creation of a vacation package with these optional details without creating a constructor with dozens of parameters.
