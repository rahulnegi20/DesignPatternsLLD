The Command Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that encapsulates a request as an object, allowing you to parameterize methods with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations. Essentially, the pattern separates the object that invokes an operation from the object that knows how to execute it.
Real-Life Example: Remote Control for Home Appliances

Imagine a remote control for home appliances like lights, fans, and TVs. Each button on the remote should perform a specific operation, like turning on/off the device or adjusting its state. With the Command Pattern, each button press can be represented as a command object, allowing us to change button functionality dynamically and even queue or undo actions.
Implementation of the Command Pattern

    We define a Command interface that all command objects implement.
    We create specific command classes, such as LightOnCommand, FanOffCommand, etc.
    We use a RemoteControl class as the invoker, which executes commands without needing to know how each command works.

Explanation

    Command Interface (Command): Provides a common interface with the execute method for all command classes.
    Concrete Commands (LightOnCommand, FanOffCommand): Each command encapsulates an action for a specific receiver, such as turning the light on or stopping the fan.
    Invoker (RemoteControl): The remote control doesnâ€™t know how commands work; it simply executes them. This provides flexibility to set different commands dynamically.
    Receivers (Light, Fan): These classes contain the actual logic to perform actions (e.g., turning on the light or starting the fan).

Real-World Use Cases for the Command Pattern

    GUI Applications: Button clicks can be encapsulated as commands, allowing for easy assignment, undo, and redo functionality.
    Transactional Systems: Each transaction can be encapsulated as a command, which can be saved and retried if it fails.
    Macro Recording: In applications where users record macros, each user action can be a command object, allowing playback in sequence.
    Game Development: Actions such as moves, attacks, and other events can be encapsulated as commands, providing a flexible action framework.

The Command Pattern is ideal for scenarios requiring decoupling between the invoker and the logic of the operation, allowing for flexibility, reusability, and enhanced maintainability in managing actions and events.
